Networking basics #1

what is the localhost ?

ocalhost" refers to the computer you are currently using. It's like referring to yourself within a network context. When you use "localhost" in a web browser or application, you're essentially talking to your own computer, not another one on the network. This is commonly used for testing websites or applications before making them publicly available, allowing developers to work and debug locally without affecting live systems.

What is 0.0.0.0?

"0.0.0.0" is an IP address with various meanings depending on its context in networking. It can represent a server configured to listen on all available network interfaces, allowing connections from any source. Alternatively, it may denote an unspecified address, indicating that no specific IP address is assigned. In both cases, it serves as a placeholder or wildcard value, facilitating flexible network configurations.

What is the hosts file ?

The "hosts" file is a plain text file found in operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux. It's utilized to directly associate domain names with specific IP addresses, bypassing the usual DNS lookup process. Essentially, it allows manual control over domain-to-IP mappings. Typically employed for development or troubleshooting, it permits redirection of domain names to different IP addresses, often for local testing purposes. However, editing it requires caution, as mistakes can disrupt network connectivity.

netcat  examples:
Netcat or nc is a networking utility for debugging and investigating the network.

This utility can be used for creating TCP/UDP connections and investigating them. The biggest use of this utility is in the scripts where we need to deal with TCP/UDP sockets.
